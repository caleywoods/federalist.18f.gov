        We are undergoing a transition to be more aligned with our cloud.gov suite of services. Federalist is changing to
        <img
          alt="cloud.gov logo icon"
          src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/logos/cg-logo-icon.svg"
        />
        <span>cloud.gov Pages</span>!
        Pages offers the same great services provided to you with your current Federalist agreement, just with a new name along with some new features soon to come. We are working on a transition guide and FAQ, and will start publishing updates soon.
      </p>
      <p class="pages-prose">
        We appreciate your continued support and are very excited with this transition and the future of the platform.
